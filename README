About
	For each failed NUnit test, instructions will be displayed. In particular,
	the default configuration will encourage you to do some exercise, or
	learn hip-hop dancing.

Installation
	As per installing an NUnit addin, please the downloaded files
	into "nunit/bin/addins" folder (make it, if it doesn't exist). 
	The current version was developed against NUnit NUnit-2.6.0.12051.
	
	You can grab the source from github: https://github.com/silky/tdg and
	build a new version for whatever version of NUnit you may have (you'll
	just need to reference the appropriate dll).

Usage
	Once installed, it will work immediately. To disable it, just
	rename the ".dll" to ".temp" (as NUnit looks for addins with
	".dll" extension), or just simply delete it.

Bugs
	Report them on the github address above website.
